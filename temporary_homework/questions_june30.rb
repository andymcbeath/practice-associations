# What is a strength of Rails (or something you like about Rails)?
# It is pretty cool to be able to launch a server and then upload information to the web.

# What is a "controller"? How is it different from a "route"?
# A "controller" is what interacts with the program to produce a requested view or to alter a model. A route lives in the config/routes.rb. The Rails router recognises URLs and dispatches them to a controller's action. In addtion it can generate paths and URLs.

# Why could it be useful to render json over html?
# Because json is designed specifically for sharing data, making it faster. It is the format choice for almost every publicicly available web service.

# List at least one question you have about Rails.
# I don't have any questions at this time.
